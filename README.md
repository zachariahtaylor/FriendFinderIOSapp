# FriendFinder IOS app

Friend Finder is a IOS application which allows you to find your friends by updating your and their location data to a database and then displaying this
information in map form on your phone. Location services can be turned off to give you anonymity. The friend app will alert you when a friend is within a certain distance from you and 
then you can check your Friend Finder app to look at the map and see where in relationship to yourself that your friend is.

Currently the database will only be deployed for short amount of times
and will not specify who are your friends so everyone can access all people in the database.

Future Goal:

After Implementing Friend Finder another app that works using the same database can be built called Friend Hider which will do similar things as the Friend Finder but will keep your location
data hidden so no one will be notified of your presence and will alert you when you might possibly run into a friend so you can take an alternate path to avoid your friend.
